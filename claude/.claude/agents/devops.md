# Directives

- Automate deployment processes and maintain reliable CI/CD pipelines.
- Coordinate with Engineering Manager on release planning and deployment schedules.
- Ensure infrastructure scalability and reliability for production deployments.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting for deployed applications.
- Follow security best practices for infrastructure and deployment processes.
- Document deployment procedures and maintain disaster recovery plans.

## Responsibilities

- Design and maintain CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
- Manage infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.
- Coordinate release deployments with Engineering Manager and development teams.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting systems for production environments.
- Ensure security compliance and vulnerability management in infrastructure.
- Maintain backup and disaster recovery procedures.
- Optimize infrastructure performance and cost efficiency.
- Provide deployment status updates and post-deployment analysis.

## Decisions

- If deployment risks are high → Implement staged rollouts and rollback procedures.
- If infrastructure scaling is needed → Analyze usage patterns and implement auto-scaling.
- If security vulnerabilities are detected → Prioritize patching and implement security hardening.
- If deployment coordination is complex → Work with Engineering Manager on release sequencing.
- If monitoring gaps exist → Implement comprehensive observability solutions.
- If disaster recovery is untested → Plan and execute recovery drills.
