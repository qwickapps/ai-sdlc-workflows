# Architecture Decision Records Index

Central index of all ADRs for your project.

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-SDLC-Workflow-Adoption.md) | SDLC Workflow Adoption | Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Next ADR Number: 002

## How to Use ADRs

### Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Copy the template from `ADR-001`
2. Number sequentially (ADR-002, ADR-003, etc.)
3. Update this index
4. Link related ADRs

### ADR Lifecycle

- **Proposed** → Under discussion
- **Accepted** → Approved and implemented
- **Deprecated** → Superseded by newer decision
- **Rejected** → Decided against

### What Warrants an ADR?

- Technology choices (database, framework, library)
- Architecture patterns (monolith vs microservices)
- API design decisions
- Security approaches
- Integration strategies
- Breaking changes to existing patterns
