# Project Development Guidelines

<!--
  This file configures AI assistant behavior for your project.
  Customize the sections below for your specific needs.

  The SDLC Workflows section is managed by ai-sdlc-workflows.
  To update it, run: ~/.ai-sdlc-workflows/update.sh
-->

## Project Overview

<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->

**Project Name:** {PROJECT_NAME}

**Description:** {BRIEF_DESCRIPTION}

**Tech Stack:** {LIST_TECHNOLOGIES}

---

## Project-Specific Rules

<!-- Add rules specific to your project/team -->

### Code Style
<!-- Examples:
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components over class components
- Use named exports, not default exports
-->

### Architecture
<!-- Examples:
- Follow hexagonal architecture
- All API calls go through the api/ layer
- State management uses Redux Toolkit
-->

### Testing
<!-- Examples:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Use React Testing Library, not Enzyme
- E2E tests for all user flows
-->

### Documentation
<!-- Examples:
- All public APIs must have JSDoc
- Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes
- Architecture decisions go in docs/adr/
-->

## CRITICAL RULES - ALWAYS FOLLOW

### 1. NEVER Auto-Commit
```
STOP. Did the user explicitly say "approved" or "commit"?
If NO → Do NOT commit. Show diff and wait for approval.
If YES → Proceed with commit.
```

### 2. NEVER Add Legacy Support
```
NO backwards compatibility unless explicitly requested
NO defensive fallbacks "just in case"
NO workarounds - fix the actual issue
Breaking changes are OK - ask if unsure
```

### 3. ALWAYS Plan Before Acting
```
For ANY non-trivial task:
1. Analyze the request
2. Check existing solutions (REUSE FIRST)
3. Present options with tradeoffs
4. Wait for user approval
5. Then implement

Use /plan for quick planning or /feature for full SDLC
```

### 4. ALWAYS Think Critically
```
DO NOT just do what user asks without thinking
DO analyze requests like an architect/PM/UX designer
DO identify potential issues
DO discuss options
DO push back when appropriate
```

### 5. ALWAYS Update Deliverables
```
After implementation, update:
- README.md (if usage changed)
- CHANGELOG.md (new entry)
- Tests (unit, integration, e2e as appropriate)
```

## SDLC Workflows

Use slash commands to enforce proper workflows:

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/feature` | New feature development (full SDLC) |
| `/bug` | Bug investigation and fix |
| `/refactor` | Code restructuring |
| `/spike` | Technical research/investigation |
| `/release` | Version release management |
| `/code-review` | Code review before commit |
| `/commit` | Controlled commit with approval |
| `/plan` | Quick planning for smaller tasks |

### Workflow Agents

Each workflow phase uses the appropriate agent persona:

| Phase | Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | product-manager | Gather needs, define scope |
| Design | architect | Technical design, REUSE FIRST |
| Test Strategy | quality-engineer | Test planning, edge cases |
| Implementation | coder | Clean code, no legacy support |
| Review | reviewer | Quality, security, patterns |
| Documentation | tech-writer | README, CHANGELOG, docs |
| Coordination | engineering-manager | Multi-team, releases |

## Customization

### Adding Custom Commands

Create a new file in `.claude/commands/` (not a symlink):

```bash
# Create local command
cat > .claude/commands/my-command.md << 'EOF'
---
description: My custom command
---
# My Command

## Steps
1. Do something
2. Do something else
EOF
```

### Overriding Framework Commands

1. Remove the symlink: `rm .claude/commands/bug.md`
2. Create your own version: `touch .claude/commands/bug.md`
3. Edit as needed

### Adding Project-Specific Rules

Create files in `.claude/rules/` (not symlinks):

```bash
cat > .claude/rules/PROJECT-CONVENTIONS.md << 'EOF'
# Project Conventions

## Naming
- Use PascalCase for components
- Use camelCase for functions
...
EOF
```

## Updates

This project uses [ai-sdlc-workflows](https://github.com/qwickapps/ai-sdlc-workflows).

To update the framework:
```bash
~/.ai-sdlc-workflows/update.sh
```

All symlinked files are automatically updated. Local customizations are preserved.
